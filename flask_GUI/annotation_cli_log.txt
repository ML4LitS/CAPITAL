{"Input": "We give an explanation for the onset of fluid-flow-induced flutter in a flag. Our theory accounts for the various physical mechanisms at work: the finite length and the small but finite bending stiffness of the flag, the unsteadiness of the flow, the added mass effect, and vortex shedding from the trailing edge. Our analysis allows us to predict a critical speed for the onset of flapping as well as the frequency of flapping. We find that in a particular limit corresponding to a low-density fluid flowing over a soft high-density flag, the flapping instability is akin to a resonance between the mode of oscillation of a rigid pivoted airfoil in a flow and a hinged-free elastic plate vibrating", "Output": []}

{"Input": "The diagnostic challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in rapid development of diagnostic test methods for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Serology tests to detect the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 enable detection of past infection and may detect cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection that were missed by earlier diagnostic tests. Understanding the diagnostic accuracy of serology tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection may enable development of effective diagnostic and management pathways, inform public health management decisions and understanding of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology.\nObjectives\nTo assess the accuracy of antibody tests, firstly, to determine if a person presenting in the community, or in primary or secondary care has current SARS-CoV-2 infection according to time after onset of infection and, secondly, to determine if a person has previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Sources of heterogeneity investigated included: timing of test, test method, SARS-CoV-2 antigen used, test brand, and reference standard for non-SARS-CoV-2 cases.\nSearch methods\nThe COVID-19 Open Access Project living evidence database from the University of Bern (which includes daily updates from PubMed and Embase and preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv) was searched on 30 September 2020. We included additional publications from the Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and Co-ordinating Centre (EPPI-Centre) 'COVID-19: Living map of the evidence' and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health 'NIPH systematic and living map on COVID-19 evidence'. We did not apply language restrictions.\nSelection criteria\nWe included test accuracy studies of any design that evaluated commercially produced serology tests, targeting IgG, IgM, IgA alone, or in combination. Studies must have provided data for sensitivity, that could be allocated to a predefined time period after onset of symptoms, or after a positive RT-PCR test. Small studies with fewer than 25 SARS-CoV-2 infection cases were excluded. We included any reference standard to define the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 (including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests (RT-PCR), clinical diagnostic criteria, and pre-pandemic samples).", "Output": [[46, 54, "DS", "C5203670", 0.962, "C5203670", "http://linkedlifedata.com/resource/umls-concept/C5203670"], [135, 143, "OG", "2901879", 0.938, "2901879", "http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/2901879"], [143, 155, "DS", "C3686551", 0.853, "C3686551", "http://linkedlifedata.com/resource/umls-concept/C3686551"], [198, 208, "GP", "P36991", 0.922, "P36991", "https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P36991/entry"], [212, 222, "OG", "2697049", 0.922, "2697049", "http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/2697049"], [248, 257, "DS", "C3714514", 0.995, "C3714514", "http://linkedlifedata.com/resource/umls-concept/C3714514"], [282, 290, "OG", "2901879", 0.733, "2901879", "http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/2901879"], [290, 302, "DS", "C3686551", 0.904, "C3686551", "http://linkedlifedata.com/resource/umls-concept/C3686551"], [409, 429, "DS", "C5203670", 0.828, "C5203670", "http://linkedlifedata.com/resource/umls-concept/C5203670"], [565, 575, "OG", "2697049", 0.916, "2697049", "http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/2697049"], [627, 635, "GP", "Q01955", 0.944, "Q01955", "https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q01955/entry"], [750, 754, "DS", "C1175175", 0.611, "C1175175", "http://linkedlifedata.com/resource/umls-concept/C1175175"], [754, 755, "OG", "2738476", 0.71, "2738476", "http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/2738476"], [755, 758, "DS", "No Match", 0.547, null, "#"], [758, 759, "OG", "2738476", 0.596, "2738476", "http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/2738476"], [759, 770, "DS", "C3686551", 0.958, "C3686551", "http://linkedlifedata.com/resource/umls-concept/C3686551"], [804, 813, "DS", "C3714514", 0.997, "C3714514", "http://linkedlifedata.com/resource/umls-concept/C3714514"], [888, 898, "OG", "2697049", 0.968, "2697049", "http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/2697049"], [977, 987, "OG", "2697049", 0.956, "2697049", "http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/2697049"], [1045, 1055, "OG", "2697049", 0.968, "2697049", "http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/2697049"], [1082, 1090, "DS", "C5203670", 0.917, "C5203670", "http://linkedlifedata.com/resource/umls-concept/C5203670"], [1422, 1430, "DS", "C5203670", 0.992, "C5203670", "http://linkedlifedata.com/resource/umls-concept/C5203670"], [1540, 1548, "DS", "C5203670", 0.991, "C5203670", "http://linkedlifedata.com/resource/umls-concept/C5203670"], [1730, 1733, "GP", "No Match", 0.997, null, "#"], [1735, 1738, "GP", "No Match", 0.997, null, "#"], [1740, 1743, "GP", "P09790", 0.998, "P09790", "https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P09790/entry"], [1919, 1922, "EM", "OBI_0000415", 0.973, "OBI_0000415", "#"], [1962, 1982, "DS", "C5203670", 0.932, "C5203670", "http://linkedlifedata.com/resource/umls-concept/C5203670"], [2076, 2086, "OG", "2697049", 0.948, "2697049", "http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/2697049"], [2098, 2119, "GO", "GO_0001171", 0.986, "GO_0001171", "http://identifiers.org/go/GO:0001171"], [2156, 2159, "EM", "OBI_0000415", 0.94, "OBI_0000415", "#"]]}
{"Input": "The study investigates the role of the BRCA1 gene and its protein product in the regulation of apoptosis in Homo sapiens cells under oxidative stress, a known contributor to various cancers, including breast carcinoma. Using RNA interference (RNAi) assays and immunoprecipitation techniques, we identified significant alterations in the cellular response pathways, specifically impacting the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Quantitative mass spectrometry was employed to profile changes in protein abundance and phosphorylation status upon treatment with doxorubicin, a chemotherapeutic drug commonly used to target tumor cells. Our findings reveal that oxidative stress not only modifies BRCA1 interaction with G1/S-specific cyclin-E1 (CCNE1) but also initiates a cascade of biological processes, including the activation of DNA repair pathways and the regulation of cell cycle checkpoints, classified under the gene ontology (GO) term GO:0006974 (DNA damage response). Furthermore, bioinformatics analyses indicate a critical role for GO:0005634 (nucleus) and GO:0005737 (cytoplasm) as cellular components for this interaction. The downregulation of caspase 3 activity, linked to molecular function GO:0004197 (cysteine-type endopeptidase activity), suggests an apoptotic block that may contribute to tumor resilience.

{"Input": "The cytoskeleton plays a key role in cellular proliferation, cell-shape maintenance and internal cellular organization. Cells are highly sensitive to changes in microgravity, which can induce alterations in the distribution of the cytoskeletal and cell proliferation. This study aimed to assess the effects of simulated microgravity (SMG) on the proliferation and expression of major cell cycle-related regulators and cytoskeletal proteins in human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSCs). A WST-1 assay showed that the proliferation of SMG-exposed hucMSCs was lower than a control group. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that the percentage of SMG-exposed hucMSCs in the G0/G1 phase was higher than the control group. A western blot analysis revealed there was a downregulation of cyclin A1 and A2 expression in SMG-exposed hucMSCs as well. The expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (cdk4) and 6 (cdk6) were also observed to be reduced in the SMG-exposed hucMSCs. The total nuclear intensity of SMG-exposed hucMSCs was also lower than the control group. However, there were no differences in the nuclear area or nuclear-shape value of hucMSCs from the SMG and control groups. A western blot and quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that SMG-exposed hucMSCs experienced a downregulation of bata-actin and alpha-tubulin compared to the control group. SMG generated the reorganization of microtubules and microfilaments in hucMSCs. Our study supports the idea that the downregulation of major cell cycle-related proteins and cytoskeletal proteins results in the remodeling of the cytoskeleton and the proliferation of hucMSCs.", "Output": [[4, 16, "GO", "GO_0005856", 0.998, "GO_0005856", "http://identifiers.org/go/GO:0005856"], [106, 118, "GO", "GO_0010111", 0.998, "GO_0010111", "http://identifiers.org/go/GO:0010111"], [248, 266, "GO", "GO_0001834", 0.983, "GO_0001834", "http://identifiers.org/go/GO:0001834"], [384, 413, "GP", "Q9BT30", 0.68, "Q9BT30", "https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q9BT30/entry"], [418, 439, "GP", "Q60771", 0.952, "Q60771", "https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q60771/entry"], [443, 448, "OG", "9606", 0.997, "9606", "http://identifiers.org/taxonomy/9606"], [506, 511, "EM", "OBI_0000070", 0.992, "OBI_0000070", "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000070"], [610, 624, "EM", "MI_0054", 0.99, "MI_0054", "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MI_0054"], [700, 708, "GO", "GO_0051318", 0.738, "GO_0051318", "http://identifiers.org/go/GO:0051318"], [807, 816, "GP", "No Match", 0.996, null, "#"], [885, 910, "GP", "Q7XDH8", 0.989, "Q7XDH8", "https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q7XDH8/entry"], [912, 916, "GP", "Q91727", 0.999, "Q91727", "https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q91727/entry"], [925, 929, "GP", "No Match", 0.999, null, "#"], [1239, 1242, "EM", "OBI_0000415", 0.993, "OBI_0000415", "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000415"], [1316, 1326, "GP", "P63269", 0.991, "P63269", "https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P63269/entry"], [1331, 1344, "GP", "Q9SCC8", 0.994, "Q9SCC8", "https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q9SCC8/entry"], [1412, 1424, "GO", "GO_0005828", 0.986, "GO_0005828", "http://identifiers.org/go/GO:0005828"], [1429, 1443, "GO", "GO_0030042", 0.883, "GO_0030042", "http://identifiers.org/go/GO:0030042"], [1517, 1544, "GP", "Q2J7H0", 0.886, "Q2J7H0", "https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q2J7H0/entry"], [1549, 1570, "GP", "Q60771", 0.987, "Q60771", "https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q60771/entry"], [1604, 1616, "GO", "GO_0005856", 0.998, "GO_0005856", "http://identifiers.org/go/GO:0005856"]]}
