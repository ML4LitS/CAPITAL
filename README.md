# Replace dictionary text mining in Europe PMC with Machine Learning based annotations

The project aims to replace the existing dictionary text mining approach with a machine learning-based solution. 
This shift is expected to improve the efficiency and accuracy of information extraction from resources. 
The project is divided into several tasks to be completed over multiple phases.

By replacing the existing dictionary text mining with machine learning, the project aims to enhance the overall efficiency, accuracy, and effectiveness of information extraction from resources. 
The successful implementation of this project is expected to have a positive impact on the Europe PMCs data processing capabilities and ultimately improve the quality of the Annotations.


### Objectives:
1. Implemement deep learning models for entity recognition
2. Implement entity linking tool which links the entities recognised to a knowledgebase.
